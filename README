## TODO

Before production:

 - goog analytics √
 - page caching
 - tweet button with bitly link and revised text
 - hat promo √ (looks ghetto but there)
 - lock down security of methods √
 - model validation (not nulls) √
 - make Contender lookup/randomization more efficient? (in memory versus postgres?)
 
 
## TO RUN LOCALLY
 
(E.g. instructions for collaborators.)
 
To get going, after cloning the repo do the following:
 
    bundle install  #get all needed gems and versions of rails up and going
    rake db:migrate #set up the local db
    rake db:seed    #load in the seed data to db (e.g. the contenders)

To run locally, use `foreman start`.

The contenders are stored in `/db/seeds.rb`.  I'm lazy and just use `uname` as the unique key for the filenames for the associated images for a contender.
